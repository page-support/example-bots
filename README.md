## Example extended markdown / tags for page.support bots
This repository contains examples of different use cases and use of our extended markdown / tags. A good way to start is to clone this repository and start editing your own bots on Github. This will give you a place to save bot definition files and collaborate with your team. You can edit and save files in Github, then paste the markdown into the [publisher](https://publisher.page.support) to test them before deploying them. 

You can also see some of these in production at [page.support](https://page.support) - click Product in the top bar. The travelRecommender bot is the `Recommender use case`, and the appleSubscriptionCancellationGuide is the `guide use case`. You can also paste any of these into the publisher to see how to look. Note that images won't show in publisher unless you are hosting them somewhere accessible to the public internet and set the image links in markdown to use those image URLs. 

If you have an example bot you'd like to share, or an improvement to suggest, send us a pull request.
