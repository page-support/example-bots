## Example extended markdown / tags for page.support bots
This repository contains examples of different use cases and use of our extended markdown / tags. A good way to start is to clone this repository and start editing your own bots on Github. This will give you a place to save bot definition files and collaborate with your team. You can edit and save files in Github, then paste the markdown into the [publisher](https://publisher.page.support) to test them before deploying them. 

If you have an example bot you'd like to share, or an improvement to suggest, send us a pull request.
